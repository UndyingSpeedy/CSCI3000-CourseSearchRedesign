UNG Course Search Redesign
--------------------------

Introduction
-------------
We found the UNG course search UI to be largely inefficient and not user friendly so we set out to correct these issues.
The most glaring issues are:
	* Inefficient use of white space
	* Lack of organization 
	* Improperly utilized reset option
	* Too many dropdowns 
Improving upon these areas results in an overall more positive experience for students when searching for courses.

Usage
-----
Once the webpage is loaded:	
	* Select 1, several, or all Course Terms
	* Select 1, several, or all Parts of Term
	* Select 1, several, or all Campuses
	* Select 1, several, or all Course levels
After these options are specified, every other field is defaulted to all options. At this point results can be generated,
but change as many parameters as desired. 

Populate the results window by:
	* Click the "Search" button 
	
Update search parameters:
	* Seamlessly update search parameters by changing an option and clicking the search button again even if results are 
	  already generated

Reset all parameters:
	* Click the "Reset" buttom 

Conclusion
----------
This design allows the user to search, update, and reset search parameters all from the same window.
